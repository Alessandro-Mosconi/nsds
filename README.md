# Networked Software for Distributed Systems

## Project Overview

This project is part of the coursework for the "Networked Software for Distributed Systems" class at Politecnico di Milano, held by prof. Luca Mottola and prof. Alessandro Margara during the academic year 2023-2024. The project explores various middleware technologies and frameworks, designed for large-scale network applications and distributed systems.

The key technologies covered in this project include:

- **<a href="../master/akka">AKKA</a>**: A toolkit implementing the actor model for building highly concurrent, fault-tolerant applications, using a message-based, asynchronous communication.
- **<a href="../master/kafka">KAFKA</a>**: A distributed messaging system designed for high-throughput, low-latency data streaming and real-time event processing.
- **<a href="../master/spark">SPARK</a>**: A unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing with built-in modules for SQL, streaming, machine learning, and graph processing.
- **<a href="../master/node_red">NODE_RED</a>**: A flow-based development tool for visual programming, primarily used to connect hardware devices, APIs, and online services.
